# README-Generator
This is my submission for an assignment where I was tasked to create an application in Node.js that can generate README.md files. I applied Inquirer.js via an npm install in the Visual Studio Code terminal within my application that works with a JavaScript file that I had developed to provide the end-client with questions which in return, when answered, generates a README Markdown file with the provided answers.
